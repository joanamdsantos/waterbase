## Installation
The code is written in Python 3. Anaconda distribution can be used to use the files in this project.

## Project Motivation
Waterbase is a project directed at using the water database from the European Environment Agency, on the status and quality of Europe's groundwaters. The most critical parameters are related to pH, alkalinity, nitrate, heavy metals, pesticides and other xenobiotic substances. These substances may be harmful to the environment and for humans in the case of using the groundwater for water irrigation or drinking. In this research, I will use the waterbase to infer:

1. How many points of measure do the parameters exceed maximum values, in what percentage?
2. With regards to xenobiotic substances, which are the more common?
3. Is there a correlation or projection between xenobiotic substances and other substances?

## Files Descriptions
With this project, there are two notebooks regarding the data exploration and modelling, along with a python file with functions used in the analysis.

## Results
When the analysis is concluded, the findings will be published with a link provided here.
